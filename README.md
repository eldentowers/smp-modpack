This guide assumes you are using a machine compatible with Modrinth (or another launcher that can import .mrpack files), and already have a Minecraft: Java Edition account.

# Installation (Existing Instance)
1. Install the latest `eldensmp-mods.zip` file from the [releases tab (v1.0.3-1.21.10)](https://github.com/eldentowers/smp-modpack/releases) and extract (unzip) it 
2. Locate your modpack instance folder (contains folders like "mods", "resourcepacks", "saves")
3. **Delete** the "mods" folder
4. Replace the "mods" folder with the "mods" folder from the extracted zip archive
5. Launch your game with the new mods, and your settings/map data preserved!

# Installation (New Instance)
This modpack uses **Modrinth**. Download the Modrinth App [here](https://modrinth.com/app) before continuing. The [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) also has the ability to import Modrinth pack files, if you wish to use it instead.

1. Install the latest `eldensmp-java.mrpack` file from the [releases tab (v1.0.3-1.21.10)](https://github.com/eldentowers/smp-modpack/releases).
2. Run the `eldensmp-java.mrpack` file to create a new instance in the Modrinth App. Only run the file once, or you will create multiple duplicate instances.
  - If you're using **Prism Launcher**, create a new instance and choose **Import**. Then, choose the `eldensmp-java.mrpack` file to create the instance.  
3. Ensure you are logged in to the Modrinth App, and launch the new instance.
4. Basic options are set by default, and the Elden Towers SMP is available on the server list by default. Keep reading to learn more about the features.

**If you have previously run the modpack and wish to update without resetting your settings, a zip archive is available with each release containing ONLY the "mods" folder. Simply delete your existing mods folder, replace it with the new one, and launch your game.**
You may need to update your Minecraft version yourself as well.

# Shaders
This modpack features [Bloop Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/bloop-shaders) by [espen96](https://modrinth.com/user/espen96)

Shaders are enabled by default, but using the lowest quality preset.

To change the shader settings (including the quality preset), press `O` to open the shader menu.
To disable shaders altogether, press `K` to toggle shaders on/off

# Resource Packs
[Unique Dark Refined](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unique-dark-refined) by [amongstreality](https://modrinth.com/user/amongstreality) is enabled by default, along with a few compatibility-related packs.

# Keybinds
These keybinds are set by default.

### Journeymap
- **Create a Waypoint (current position)**: `B`
- **Open/Close fullscreen map**: `M`
- **Show/hide waypoints**: `[`
- **Open waypoint settings**: `]`
- **Zoom minimap IN**: `=`
- **Zoom minimap OUT**: `-`

- **Enable/disable Shaders**: `K`
### Zoomify [1.21.10 only] (Zoom In)

Vanilla Java keybinds are mostly unchanged, with only a few unnecessary keybinds disabled, such as creative mode hotbar saves and miscellaneous function key (F#) actions.
